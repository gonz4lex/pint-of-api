## RESTful APIs

These are APIs that follow the REST (REpresentational State Transfer) architectural style.

Client and server are independent of each other and make no assumptions.
The only constant must be the format in which the data is returned.

These are _stateless_ systems, meaning the client does not need prior knowledge of the state of the server and vice versa.
This paradigm is enforced by interacting with resources through standard operations.

Note that there are also SOAP APIs.
