#### Endpoints

An endpoint is a path that points to a resource.

For example, api.mtsglobe.com/clients/77/ or api.mtsglobe.com/bookings/8653.  
This endpoint can be used, for instance, in a GET request to retrieve information about the specific resource. 

Some examples of endpoints we use:
- https://wvw.last-minito.de/api/hotel/
- https://skyscanner-skyscanner-flight-search-v1.p.rapidapi.com/apiservices/pricing/uk2/v1.0/
