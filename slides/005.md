## Communication

In the REST architecture, the client sends a request that retrieves or modifies a given resource, and the server sends a response to the request.

### Requests

A request generally consists of:

- and _HTTP verb_ defining the operation to perform
- a _header_, containing metadata about the request
- a path to a resource, also called an _endpoint_
- an optional _message body_ with a data payload
