### Responses

Responses from the server generally contain the data payload requested by the client as well as response metadata, such as status code and content type.

#### Response codes

Responses contain information of the success status of the operation, to inform the client of its success (or failure). There are many such codes, but it's only important to know the most common ones and learn how they can be used.

| Status code                   | Meaning                                                                   |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `200 (OK)`                    | Succesful standard HTTP request.                                          |
| `201 (CREATED)`               | Succesful request that results in the creation of an item.                |
| `203 (NO CONTENT)`            | Succesful request that returns an empty response body.                    |
| `400 (BAD REQUEST)`           | Unsuccesful request due to client error such as bad syntax.               |
| `403 (FORBIDDEN)`             | Unsuccesful request due to lack of authentication or credentials.         |
| `404 (NOT FOUND)`             | Unsuccesful request because the resource could not be found.              |
| `500 (INTERNAL SERVER ERROR)` | Generic response to unexpected failure when no further info is available. |


You should get used to error __code 429__, which stands for _Too Many Requests_. You will be seeing that a lot.
