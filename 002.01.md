## Definition

API stands for Application Programming Interface, a set of protocols and tools that allow interaction between two different applications.
  
In other words, it's an _interface_ that makes it easier for developers to _program_ different _applications_. While end users consume __UIs__, us developers can use __APIs__ to access a larger range of functionalities.
